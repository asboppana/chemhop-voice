# chemhop-voice

**Project Name:** ChemHop Voice

**Description:** Voice Driven Scaffold Hopping of Drug Molecules into Synthesizable/IP-Free Chemical Space

**Value:** We believe voice-controlled molecule editing is the next-gen interface to allow medicinal chemists to modify their molecules of interest, removing bottlenecks of local code scriptings. Allows a medicinal chemist to modify a drug scaffold via voice commands by referencing either algorithmically defined regions/substructures of a molecule or semantic names of ring systems from their days of organic chemistry.
